    "- Computational documents (like .docx or .xlsx files) that combine code and text\n",
    "- Consist of cells that are either Python code cells or Markdown text cells\n",
    "- Used for prototyping, brainstorming, and note-taking with executable code - not for full software development\n",
    "- Different from IDEs - designed for exploration rather than development\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Basics:**\n",
    "- Anaconda is a scientific Python distribution that includes Jupyter Lab\n",
    "- Jupyter Lab is a web application for creating and editing notebooks\n",
    "- New cells default to Python code; can be converted to Markdown for text\n",
    "- Execute cells with Shift+Return or the triangle button\n",
    "- Convert cell types using Esc+M (Markdown) or Esc+Y (Python)\n",

    "**Organization Best Practices:**\n",
    "Create a structured folder system:\n",
    "- Main folder: COMP_4030\n",
    "- Subfolders: Assignments, My_Notebooks, Teacher_Notebooks\n",
    "- Always move downloaded notebooks from Downloads folder to proper course directories\n",
